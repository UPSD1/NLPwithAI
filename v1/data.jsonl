Since the self-attention calculation combines with the current input information about other relevant inputs, is it only possible to parallelize a transformer encoder or decoder layer one at a time? It seems like all outputs are needed between encoder or decoder layers in order to calculate self attention for the next layer.\n\n4. In the Bert transformer encoder stack, how would the progression of inputs through the stack work for a spam classifier? Here is how I think it would work. For each encoder (consisting of a self-attention layer and a FCNN), for each token input (starting with the [CLS] token, perform self attention. Take the new value vectors and perform an element wise sum with their respective original input embeddings (due to the residual connection). Feed each new value vector through the FCNN component of the encoder transformer block. You will now have a number of intermediate outputs equal to the number of original input tokens. Repeat this process for all encoder blocks in the transformer. For the final encoder block, take the output resulting from the first input (which maps back to the original [CLS] token) and feed this through a separate FFCN followed by a softmax operation to predict spam/not spam.\n\nThank you for your help with these questions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

They are element wise sums but this is likely out of scope for what you will be tested on (think about what we spent time on and what is critical as a takeaway from this course). Good for your knowledge though!\n\n3. I am a bit confused what you are asking here. The transformer effectively is very similar now to the FFNN and you still process layers sequentially (but there are tricks to actually make this parallel too) but you lose the forward sequence making it parallel with respect to the sequence.\n\n4. Yep that is about right but that\u2019s a bit too deep in the weeds I would say. Think about BERT as one entity and learn about it. Then for task specific challenges with BERT, think about what do I need to change (add, remove, modify) to make BERT work for this task?\n\nFor example, if I wanted to do summarization, I might need to think about what I put at my input (split by SEP token and CLS token) as well as having a FFNN with a softmax at the end to classify whether to include this sentence or not.\n\nNotice how I didn\u2019t talk about the internals since they weren\u2019t as critical to the Application of BERT to this task?

Often we ultimately want extrinsic evaluation, as our end goal is to make a model that does well on some particular task (NER, sentiment analysis, etc.) The main drawbacks are that it's expensive to compute and often requires extra annotated data, hence we can use intrinsic evaluation whenever we need a cheaper form of evaluation, or we want to evaluate models before deciding exactly what task we want to use them for."}]}

I'm experiencing heavy cough and congestion, achiness and soreness, pounding headaches, and light nausea. This is obviously really embarrassing for me to have to say out loud, but I'm reaching a breaking point and I wanted to reach out for support. \n\nLast night, I was taking my first final which I thought would go fine because I had studied and it was open notes and we had an extra 2 hours, but I had never felt so delirious and distracted during an exam in my entire life.

As a student, I really need a good night's sleep to feel alert and ready to study or take an exam, so this is really distressing me for how I will perform for the next few days.\n\nI am so so so appreciative of course staff moving the final online so that I cannot infect anyone, especially anybody who is or knows someone who is immunocompromised. It really means a lot that you take the time to hear us out as we voice our concerns.\n\nI am writing this because I feel as if I am going to study very poorly for the next few days and perform terribly during the actual exam.

However, why not just have the output of the sigmoid perform an element wise sum with the previous cell state directly?

My partner and I are choosing to do a quantitative analysis and was wondering if we could receive further clarification for the requirements and what we are expected to include in the analysis. \n\nHere are the instructions from the writeup for quantitative analysis: \n\n\"you will need to further break down the quantitative statistics you reported initially. We provide some initial strategies to prime you for what you should think about in doing this: one possible starting point is to consider: if model \ud835\udc4b achieves greater accuracy than model \ud835\udc4c , to what extent is \ud835\udc4b getting everything correct that \ud835\udc4c gets correct? Alternatively, how is model performance affected if you measure performance on a specific strata/subset of the source sentences?\"\n\nWhat does it mean to \"break down the quantitative statistics\"? To determine the extent in which X is getting everything correct that Y gets correct; do we have to use arbitrary tests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I warn you this is a long answer. Read every detail of this even if you are doing a qualitative study! I discuss both qualitative and qualitative.\n\n(1) We can't give an exact breakdown of what you are graded on because it is quite literally the depth and quality of your ablation study. Yes, I realize that it seems arbitrary but it isn't that arbitrary. What I mean is that you will need to at the minimum hit a few points for any ablation study. These should be clear from the instructions but I will reiterate in a step-wise manner\n\nWhat are your modifications?\n\nWhat's the logic / reasoning or intuition for the modification?\n\nNote: This intuition / logic / reasoning can be founded on prior studies, linguistics, something we discussed in class, some knowledge elsewhere or your own intuition (if it's your intuition it helps to give en example or idea of why this might be intuitive).\n\nGeneral results of study: This is the part of the instructions that tell you to give us the BLEU and perplexity scores for validation. Putting it in a table is perfect\n\nNuanced analysis: Quantitative or qualitative study looking deeper into the models. For either of these choices, you will have to do a deeper analysis on the model, discuss the performance along with hypotheses on why Mod A does something while Mod B is unable to (and vice versa). This is discussed along all the 4 models removing a modification at a time (hence ablation study)\n\n(2) Now that we have everything except the nuanced analysis, what do we actually do? Well first we select qualitative or quantitative. I will discuss both below since people will select either one. I want to emphasize the following point: Just copying the suggestions below does not guarantee a perfect or high score! These are suggestions of ideas on how to analyze further or more in depth but they still require effort on your part regarding the depth and quality of your analysis! Now onto the details\n\nQualitative analysis: Select a handful of examples (like 4 or so) where the models may produce similar or different output. Variety is OK here!\n\nLook at the style transfer between the four models (i.e. does it look like it came from Shakespeare?). Are there examples they all can transfer well or they all fail on? What about ones that ModA+ModB and ModB does well? Why might this be?\n\nWhat about semantic meaning between the four models (i.e. do the translations maintain the same meaning)? Are there examples they all can transfer the meaning well or all fail to transfer meaning? What about ones that ModA+ModB and ModA does well? Why might this be?\n\nQuantitative analysis: We now may want to see how the different models compare against each other.\n\nMaybe length of the sequence is a major component to the performance gain of ModA and ModA+ModB. To test this, we can split the sequences into different bucket lengths and evaluate all of the models on these different lengths. Now we may see that ModB performs extremely well on long sequences but ModA+ModB performs generally better. So does ModA especially on shorter sequences. So by removing ModA, our model loses the ability to accurately translate shorter sequences. And so on....\n\nMaybe we want to see how ModA stacks up against ModA+ModB. We can fix a set of sentences that ModA does well on (you have to determine what well is here), then see how does ModA+ModB does on this same set. Does ModA+ModB do just as well on that subset or does it's potential performance gain come from somewhere else (maybe the subset of ModB or some mixture)?\n\nAnother interesting route is looking at the phrase categories that are generated. So we can look at the references and see how many noun phrases, quantifier phrases, verb phrases, and others are within the data then look at the model generations. Maybe the data is skewed towards NP and ModA allows it to somehow pick up on this behavior. We can further break this down looking at sentences with different syntactic structures and how the model performs on these differing forms!\n\nWhew! These are just starting suggestions of what you can explore and as you can see, they are not arbitrary tests! You can get ideas from prior literature, course staff, discussing with each other what might be interesting to see, or thinking about what does it mean to have a good translation or what subsets of the data exist?\n\nHope this helps!"}]}

Both my partner and I have done some research looking at PyTorch documentation as well as the course text, and blogs online. From our research, choosing a good baseline for hidden size requires cross validation--with no hard and fast rule. Some conventional NN wisdom has taking a midway or 2/3rd point between input size(size of embedding I believe), and output size(which we think would be size of target vocab), but that would result in a very large hidden size which seems like it might cause memory issues, since there's around 10000 target vocab words. \n\nWe were hoping for some guidance on this aspect, since we can't really seem to find a good justification for choosing 512(the number given to us) as the Hidden size. \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TLDR; No magic method.

At the end of the day, you don\u2019t need a full report justifying the value but you need 1-2 sentences that say why this value and not another. It just needs to be more than \u201cI like this value\u201d or \u201cYou gave us this value\u201d.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou are right that there isn\u2019t a set magic number. The 2/3rd thing is 1 rule of thumb from Jeff Heaton but he lists quite a few others so not sure why you latched onto that one\u2026. However there is some \u201cfolklore\u201d regarding good values to use which you can rely on. Additionally, you can follow in the steps of others and choose a particular value as they have. Lastly, you can test a few different values to see what seems to perform the best. Again a full panel is not needed but testing a few values. However, let\u2019s say you want to follow the folklore or in the steps of others instead.\n\nA traditional value will always be a power of 2, specifically one greater than 16. Why? Well current instruction sets for matrix multiplication handle 64 bytes or 16 single-width floats. So if the number of nodes is divisible by 16 then it\u2019s multiplied in an efficient manner! This same argument can be applied for batch size with data being stored in a binary memory store. However, there are arguments that we don\u2019t really realize these speed gains but it is a very nice heuristic to search the space much faster (log2 vs. linear). Additionally, we are computer scientists and we like powers of 2 or nice round numbers like 1000.\n\nSo now we may or may not choose a power of 2. To select our exact hidden size, we need to research what are common hidden sizes (folklore values!) that people find to do well OR select a specific work and follow in their footsteps so it\u2019s comparable. Let\u2019s say we select a specific work. What this entails is looking online for a particular research paper or notes about a deployed system (e.g. Google translate) to see what they chose. We can then choose the exact same value and cite their work as the reason since we want to keep the hyperparameters the same. Folklore values take a bit longer to find but this can be done by looking at papers, deployed systems, blogs, etc to find commonalities within the values. For example if you do a quick search online for batch size, you will find 32 to be a very very commonly used value. Why? People find it does well and so now the \u201cfolklore\u201d says that this is a good value. These are also general rules of thumb or values you happen to see pop up everywhere.\n\nAt the end of the day, you don\u2019t need a full report justifying the value but you need 1-2 sentences that say why this value and not another.

Then if our probabilities become [0.9, 0.1] then our loss and perplexity go down however this may not change our BLEU or may change it in a worse way (if we take a bad step).\n\nLet's consider another case where probabilities of the words being [0.45, 0.55]. with the second one being correct. Then if our probabilities become [0.55, 0.45] then our loss and perplexity go up however this may change our BLEU in a positive way.

Is it why changing the learning rate can have such a huge impact on the performance of the model in general? I think this is what you are asking however if it is not, then please correct me in a follow up.\n\nHow can learning rate influence the performance so much?\n\nTo reach the local minimum in gradient descent, it is critical to set the learning rate to an appropriate value that is neither too low nor too high. The learning rate is an integral part of it because if the steps it takes are too large, it may not reach the local minimum. After all, it bounces back and forth between the convex function of gradient descent.\n\nIf the learning rate is set to a minimal value, then gradient descent will eventually reach the local minimum, however, such may take a while. Thus, the learning rate should never be too high or too low per the different scenarios shown above. If the learning rate is too large, the oscillation will diverge.\n\nAdditionally what is a \"small change\"? Since small is quite variable and my definition of small change is likely very different than yours.

Training loss is pictured below in the first image and validation perplexity is pictured in the second one. From my knowledge, I would expect training loss to initially diverge after starting training (for instance the learning rate might be too high) or a stochastic optimization procedure like Adam to eventually converge to a noise ball (e.g. the learning curve saturates/remains stagnant around some loss value). Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is no guarantee on what your loss function curve should look like (in general) unless your loss function is a strongly convex function.

Why would I think this isn\u2019t abnormal or weird? Well based on the parameters that I had set, the data, etc. what actually likely happened is that it found a local minima but the \u201cmomentum\u201d was too strong and moved it outside of this minima.

I was under the assumption that embedding size, learning rate, and batch size were all hyperparameters. However, I've seen a handful of posts treat embedding size as part of their ablation study. Further, on the assignment, it says that we must tune the hyperparameter of the hidden dimesionality. However, I was under the impression that hidden size was more fitting for the ablation study (as it was mentioned on that section of the assignment as well). Any clarification on this would be great. Further, for tuning hyperparameters, do we need different scores for each possible hyperparameter change/combination we make or would all of the changes together with their justifications be enough. \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1) So they are not entirely mutually exclusive. Hyperparameters are any value that you set prior to the training of the model. Examples include:\n\n- Embedding size\n- Learning Rate\n- Batch Size\n- Momentum\n- Number of layers\n- Etc.\n\nHOWEVER, you\u2019ll notice some of these hyperparameters actually adjust or change your model. These hyperparameters are valid choices for your ablation study as well. These include:\n\n- Embedding size\n- Number of layers\n- Hidden size\n- etc.\n\nSo an item can actually occur in both because it is something that can modify the model that is a hyperparameter! In fact most of these items are hyperparameters but a lot of hyperparameters don\u2019t modify the model such as learning rate or batch size.\n\n2) I don\u2019t think I quite understand the second question you ask. However I\u2019ll give my best attempt and you can follow up if I messed it up. For tuning hyperparameters in general, you would get scores for each combination or change in hyperparameter you make.

I also understand that by making the decision to remove project 4, students will have less stress on this course and will have more time to study for the final exam. \n\nHowever, I hope that project 4 will still be made available as an optional assignment to students so that those who are interested may still have the opportunity to do it. This is because I feel that the projects in this course are very helpful for us to really learn and understand the material taught in class. The content taught in lectures is only theoretical, but the projects provide opportunities for us to get our hands dirty and truly implement everything by ourselves. From my personal experience doing the previous projects, I feel that those projects substantially improved my understanding of the course content. Similarly, I expect that project 4 will provide us with the opportunity to fully grasp the material recently taught in lectures and significantly improve our understanding. \n\nAt the same time, I think it will be a reasonable policy to make project 4 optionable and take only the 3 highest project scores. So that students who are interested in doing the project or think they didn't do well in previous projects can choose to do it, but others would still have the freedom to choose not to do it.

So we actually evaluate word embeddings in a similar way to N-gram model. Ideally we want to measure them in an extrinsic manner on what ever task we are attempting to do. For example, if we want to generate a summary of a book then we\u2019d evaluate our word embeddings by how good they are with our model to generate a summary. This is where we get some notion of over/under fitting but we\u2019d only know that the model as a whole (word embeddings + other model such as neural network) is overfitting not necessarily which component could improve without intensive and deep testing.\n\nBut as we discussed in class, this may be difficult in some cases so it\u2019s nice to have an intrinsic measure of how \u201cgood\u201d the embedding may be. Again, this tells us nothing about over/under fitting and it only correlates with performance (not a guarantee that performance will improve).

Word analogy: When given a pair of words a and a\u2217 and a third word b, the analogy relationship between a and a\u2217 can be used to find the corresponding word b\u2217 to b.

For tasks that don't have a lot of training data, learning the embeddings + the neural network weights together for the task can often result in overfitting and hence lower test performance.

I\u2019ll add more specifics and details diving into why this is the case.\n\nIn terms of convergence, the features you use don\u2019t necessarily have an impact actually (the features can have an impact but not always). Convergence to a solution just means that we terminate and find some minima (usually a local one). Logistic Regression is actually basically a 1 layer neural network and it\u2019s loss function is convex (with $\\mathcal{L}_2$ regularization, it is strongly convex) which means we will always converge to a global optima no matter what our features or inputs are. What this means is that the speed at which we converge (number of iterations or wall time which are 2 separate things) or how well we converge (how close do we get to the actual minima, i.e. how small is this noise ball?) depends on more than just our data features / representation although representation is critical. You don\u2019t need to know convergence guarantees, what convex or strongly convex means for this class. But these are fun concepts to learn more about!\n\nHOWEVER, the feature representation can actually have quite an impact on performance in terms of F1 / Acc / BLEU etc (as you might have seen in P2 where certain features were more useful for your MaxEnt Model). For NN, it does somewhat depend on the task which one will be better but for a lot of use cases, we find that word embeddings tend to perform better. This is because they are denser features and capture some information about the word in all of its senses.

So how is it possible to replace lexical generation probability (p(word_i | tag_i)) or transition probability (p(tag_i | tag_i-1)) in the HMM with p(tag_i | features) in MEMM?\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great question!\n\nThe key property of generative models is that they model the probability P(X, Y) of the inputs X and outputs Y jointly, while a discriminative model only models P(Y | X) (from which it's not possible to directly recover P(X, Y)). The HMM does so by assuming the data was generated according to the following process: 1. we sample a sequence of tags by randomly sampling a starting tag (from the starting distribution) and, for each tag, sampling a subsequent tag from the transition distribution P(t_i | t_{i-1}). 2. for each tag in the sequence, we sample a corresponding token from the emission distribution P(w_i | t_i). The way we solve the NER task is to solve the problem, \"assuming the data was generated by this process, what is the most likely sequence of tags in step 1 that would have then generated the observed sequence of tokens in step 2?\". Given the starting, transition and emission distributions, we can then answer this question by running Viterbi. \n\nThe missing piece is how we find the starting, transition and emission distributions. In the HMM portion of the assignment, we do so by estimating these probabilities based on their observed frequencies in the training data. In the MEMM portion, if say we are using logistic regression to replace the transition probabilities, then we are further making the approximation that P(t_i | t_{i-1}) = P(t_i | features). So the logistic regression model, while discriminative, only replaces this single component -- after making this approximation, we can still perform the same procedure as above: assume the data was generated according to these probabilities and then deduce the most likely sequence of tags that results in the given observations.\n\nFinally, why should we make this approximation? The hope is that it may give more accurate probabilities since 1. it may take a ton of data to directly estimate P(t_i | t_{i-1}) by bigram counting, and 2. we can additionally use more information about the sentence than just the previous tag. However, you are correct that making this assumption breaks the generative nature of the model, since we can technically no longer assume the data was generated by the above process (for example, if some of the features depend on future words in the sentence, or other information like parts of speech). One way to put it is that we are reducing variance (if we pick the features well, we could get good probability estimates even with a limited amount of training data), at the possible cost of increasing bias (if the data was truly generated according to this process, then making an approximation of the transition probability could lead to incorrect probability estimates, hence wrong predictions), which is a fundamental tradeoff in machine learning."}]}

We lost a total of 6 points because our language model returned unigram/bigram counts rather than a probability distribution. We decided to do this because when we added smoothing later on, we felt it was much easier and made more sense to just directly increase the counts by k, and then compute probabilities later when we needed them. We then created separate functions to compute the probability of a given sentence based on these counts, and the N-gram probabilities were computed in this function. In the end, we still implemented add-k smoothing and the language models correctly, but we just returned counts instead of probabilities as a design choice. I understand that a language model should be a probability distribution of words in a corpus and not just unigram/bigram counts, but our model does exactly the same thing but just in a different way. I wanted to get a better understanding of why we lost 6 points for a relatively minor design choice.

Over the last nine or so days, this condition monopolized my time to the point that I attended only one day of classes.  \n\nI contributed to the first project to the best of my ability during this time, including coding the unigram and NB models and prediction output, as well as contributing to the perplexity calculations.  However, my partner hit a wall while working on the bigram model as a result of some of the decisions we made together when I was healthy, and I was unable to step in and help correct course during this time.  Additionally, due to being out of contact for long stretches, as communicating while my condition is in full swing is often extremely challenging for me, she thought I would be able to take on more than I was ultimately able to do.\n\nWhile I was feeling a little better by Friday, and had hoped to be able to step in and complete the project, I wasn't operating 100%, and asked my partner if we could take a late day over the weekend so I could pace myself a little more.  My partner was very understanding, and was willing to take the late penalty of the weekend to give me the additional time I needed to deliver on sorting out the issues we developed.  Unfortunately, with the amount of work that has piled up over the last two weeks of close to zero productivity and not recovering quite as fast as I had hoped, I still wasn't able to deliver on what I promised.\n\nI understand the late policy exists for a reason, and if this were just about my own grade, I doubt I'd have bothered to ask and just lived with the penalty.  That being said, I feel horrible that my personal issues in managing my condition will result in an unfair outcome for my partner.  I'm not sure if there is a fair way to resolve this, but I thought given the fact that I have pretty comprehensive SDS accommodations for this exact reason, I should ask to waive some of that penalty, even if I should have been considerably more proactive about this in every respect.\n\nFor now, I am hoping to put aside a large block of time tomorrow and Tuesday to make the changes to the bigram model necessary to get it working (we needed to apply log probabilities earlier, leverage DataFrames to accelerate the training process a great deal, and I need to clean up my code to make it readable for graders).  If at the end of tomorrow, the changes I've made seem to be worth the extra day late penalty, I'll re-submit.  \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or supporting documentation from me. My SDS letter was posted during the first few weeks of classes.  Though my accommodation/SDS advisor can support the fact that I seriously struggle to communicate around instances of my condition, as it often sets in with no warning, I understand that it is my responsibility to let course staff know in advance when I'm having issues, rather than approach you after the fact when deadlines have already passed.  I have a lot more of my support systems in play now than I did at the start of this semester, and will work with my SDS advisor to come up with a better plan of action moving forward for this year, but am happy to work directly with course staff if there's anything else I can do to prevent this from being an issue moving forward.\n\nI'm sorry for the trouble."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi Joshua, sorry for the late response.

I won't go into a full discussion on overfitting however below are a few common techniques to limit overfitting on your training data:\n\nUse a validation or held out dataset to verify that the model doesn't memorize the training data but does generalize to data from a similar distribution\n\nLimit the use of nonparametric or nonlinear models even though they have more flexibility in learning a classifier. This limits what the model can pick up or learn. The idea here is an Occam's razor test (basically \"the simplest explanation is usually the best one\")\n\nEnforce or encourage other constraints when you learn (e.g. $\\mathcal{L}_2$ Regularization where we say the squared sum of the weights should be as small as possible)\n\nDo feature selection. What I mean by this is to look at relations between variables (which words occur a lot together? If I see \"Puerto\" then it's also likely (not guaranteed) I will see \"Rico\" as well. This helps catch variables that may be highly correlated and can be removed depending on model type (e.g. NB and LR assume independence between features). Additionally, look at feature relation to the output. If it's a noisy variable then we likely don't want it as said in lecture we want predictive features.\n\nThese are the common methods for the classifiers we have learned / dealt with so far.

I am a grad student who's formally auditing this course on Student Center with permission from Professor Cardie.

Am I still allowed to do the projects and submit them for feedback by the deadlines, or would that be too much work for the graders? \n\nIf so, can I do the projects on my own instead of with a partner so that I don't hold back people who are taking this course for a grade?\n\nCornell's auditing policy says I must participate in all aspects of a course, except those which are graded (https://sce.cornell.edu/courses/register/special/auditing). From what I can see on the syllabus, all aspects of this course are graded. Is there anything specific I am required to do?\n\nThank you, I very much enjoyed the first 2 lectures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As far as I know:\n\n1. Yes you can do the projects, whether or not they will be graded will be up to the TAs at the time of grading. It depends on the capacity that each TA has to grade projects and whether someone is willing to do extra work. Please note that we also have fewer TAs this year than we usually do.\n\n2. I guess you could do the project on your own since you are auditing, however, if you do find someone else auditing the course I'd recommend you do the project with them in order to reduce the workload on the grader.\n\n3.
