Enhancing the ED Discussion Forum with a RAG-enhanced LLM for a course subject. 

The aim was to develop an AI-driven system that simulates the personalized guidance of a subject-matter expert, 
akin to a teaching assistant (TA), by employing generative Large Language Models (LLMs). The AI assistant was 
designed not to provide direct answers but to guide students through the learning process, akin to a skilled
educator encouraging exploration, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

To achieve this, the model was trained on the course material data and then leveraged a hybrid retrieval
technique combining a RAG retriever (vector + keyword search) and knowledge graph to enhance the retrieval
process. The key difference between knowledge graphs and vector search is their information retrieval approach. 
While vector search relies on semantic similarity between the query and the text content, knowledge
graphs utilize the structured relationships between nodes to traverse and connect disparate pieces of
information. This allows for a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the data, enabling the system
to provide synthesized insights.
